                    <p>ThingLearn was born from discussions with teachers and education professionals about their interest in the Internet of Things and a lack of curriculum to help students learn.</p>
                    <p>Built by Jen Looper, a developer, and Qing Hu, a professor at MIT, ThingLearn is all about easing the path for students to learn innovative tools and technologies.</p>
